The code for this project uses ROS Indigo.

You may need to install some additional packages to get things working.

Documentation is generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.org). The test framework
uses the [Google C++ Testing Framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).
You can install both of these with

    sudo apt-get install doxygen libgtest-dev

As of writing (03/15) The `libgtest-dev` package on Ubuntu 14.04 does not
install libraries, only the headers. To create the library files you need to
compile them manually (code from
[here](http://www.thebigblob.com/getting-started-with-google-test-on-ubuntu/)
and
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13513905/how-to-properly-setup-googletest-on-linux)
for some pointers).

    sudo apt-get install cmake # install cmake
    cd /usr/src/gtest
    sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
    sudo make
    
    # copy or symlink libgtest.a and libgtest_main.a to your /usr/lib folder
    sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

In the `code/test` directory there are some files which you can use to check if
things are properly configured. You can compile either with `g++` or `cmake`.

    g++ -g tests.cpp totest.cpp totest.hpp -lgtest -lpthread -o gpRun
    ./gpRun

or

    cmake CMakeLists.txt
    make
    ./runTests

# Compilation

Some of the packages used by the STRANDS project require `qt_build` and
`mongodb_store`. On Ubuntu systems set up according to the
[tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu), this can be done
with

    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-qt-build
    sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-mongodb-store

You will also require the OpenCV nonfree library. There doesn't seem to be a
package for this in Ubuntu (although `libopencv-nonfree-dev` existed at some
point). To install, download OpenCV and run the following in the top level of
the extracted zip:

    cmake CMakeLists.txt
    make

This will take a while to compile everything. It may be possible to just compile
the nonfree library, but I don't know how. Find where other libraries from
OpenCV sit on your system with `locate --regexp 'libopencv.*.so'`. For me, they
sit in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`. Copy the library files to that location.

    sudo cp lib/libopencv_nonfree* /usr/lib/x86-64-linux-gnu

And things should compile when `catkin_make` is run in the workspace.
